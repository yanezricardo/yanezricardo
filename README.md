👋 Hi, I’m @yanezricardo

👀 I’m a senior .NET developer with over 16 years of experience in software development. I specialize in building web applications using the .NET Core, and have a strong understanding of the full software development lifecycle.

🌱 I’m always looking to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and trends in the .NET ecosystem, and I'm currently focusing more Blazor.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on challenging and exciting .NET projects, and I'm open to mentoring junior developers and sharing my knowledge and experience.

📫 You can reach me via email at yanezricardo@gmail.com or through my LinkedIn profile at https://www.linkedin.com/in/yanezricardo.
